This project is a taster for the term 1 of the self driving car nanorndegree from Udacity. The objective is to use some basic OpenCV methods to mask and transform images of the road so the lanes are highligted and a line cna be drawn on top. The project is implemented in the Jupyter notebook available in the repository. The notebook shows the progression made to process the images and then the videos. The resulting videos are in the root of this project and a frame of teh video can be seen below.
